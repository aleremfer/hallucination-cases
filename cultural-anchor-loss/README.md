# Cultural Anchor Loss

This folder documents cases where language models fail to recognize or preserve
the cultural anchoring of short, ambiguous, or poetic inputs.

Instead of verifying contemporary or situational origins, the model re-anchors
the input to high-frequency, canonical cultural sources (e.g. proverbs, religious
texts, classical philosophy).

These cases are not classic factual hallucinations, but epistemic misframings
that result in loss of cultural specificity and meaning.

# Geographic Hallucinations

This folder contains documented cases of **geographic hallucinations and disambiguation failures** in large language models.

The cases focus on situations where models:
- Confuse distinct geographic entities with similar or identical names
- Fail to correctly disambiguate countries, regions, cities, or administrative units
- Produce confident but incorrect geographic inferences

These cases were originally developed as part of early factuality experiments and have been **migrated here** to align with the scope of the `hallucination-cases` repository.

They are preserved for reference and comparison with other factual hallucination patterns.
